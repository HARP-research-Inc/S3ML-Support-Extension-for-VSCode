2. Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`), and click the "Install from VSIX..." button in the Extensions view header.
3. Select the downloaded VSIX file or the cloned repository folder to install the extension.

## Usage

After installing the extension, it will automatically provide syntax highlighting and editing support for S3ML files with the `.s3ml` file extension. You can also manually set the language mode for a file by clicking on the language identifier in the bottom right corner of the status bar and selecting "S3ML".
